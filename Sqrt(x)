 *                    Implement int sqrt(int x).
 *                    Compute and return the square root of x.

 *  O(1)             The easiest way to compute square root is with base-10 log.The formula
 *                   will be 10^((log10(number))/2). However, there exist newton method and 
 *                   Babylonian method or Heron's method to compute square root effectively.
