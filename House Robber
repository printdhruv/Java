*  Problem        :
*                   You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
*                   Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of 
*                   them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police 
*                   if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
*                   Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine 
*                   the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
*                   Credits:
*                           Special thanks to @ifanchu for adding this problem and creating all test cases. 
*                           Also thanks to @ts for adding additional test cases.
*  Thoughts       => 
*                    Brute Force / Naive Approach :- The rob house method consumes O(N^3) time-complexity with an O(N^2) space
*                                                    complexity.It passes all 69/69 cases on leetcode. It's the worst approach to deal
*                                                    with a problem.
*                    Optimised Approach           :- TBD
