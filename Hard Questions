*  Problem :-
*  Vincent and Catherine are classmates who just took an exam in Math 55. The exam consists of  multiple-choice questions. 
*  Each question has  choices, each of which is represented by a single capital letter A, B, C, D and E. 
*  Each question has exactly one correct answer. A student's score is equal to the number of questions he/she correctly answered.
*  This was the hardest exam they've ever taken! No one was ever sure of their answer even after the exam, and some students weren't 
*  even able to answer all the questions. 
*  The questions were so hard that Vincent and Catherine strongly believe that they can't both be correct in any question. 
*  In other words, for each question, they believe that one or both of them must be incorrect.
*  Now, Vincent wants to know how well he could have performed in the exam. 
*  Given the answers of Vincent and Catherine, find the maximum score that Vincent could have gotten, assuming that 
*  they can't both have gotten the correct answer to any particular question.
*  Input Format
*               The first line contains a single integer , the number of questions. 
*               The second line contains a string of length  denoting the answers of Vincent. 
*               The third line contains a string of length  denoting the answers of Catherine.
*  Each answer string consists of only the characters A, B, C, D, E and . (dot character).
*       If the i'th character is A, B, C, D or E, then this character represents the student's answer for the 'th question.
*       If the i'th character is ., then this means the student gave no answer for the 'th question.
*  Constraints
*       1<=n<=100
*  Output
*       Print a single line containing a single integer denoting the maximum score that Vincent could have gotten assuming that 
*       they can't both have gotten the correct answer to any particular question.
*  Sample Input 0
*       24
*       CCACCBAEBAAAAAAAA.......
*       CCACCBAEBAAAAAAAA.......
*  Sample Output 0
*       0
*  Explanation 0
*       In this case, Vincent and Catherine answered exactly the same for the whole exam. Since they can't both be correct in 
*       any question, it means they are both incorrect in every question. Hence, they both score 0.
