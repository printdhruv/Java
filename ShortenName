*  Problem Name   : ShortenName 
*  Used In        : codefights.com
*  Used As        : Challange
*  Thoughts     => 
*  You need to insert a bunch of names into the database, but some of them are too large and should be shortened. 
*  Each name is given in one of the two formats:
*  <surname>, <name> <middlename>; 
*  <surname>, <name>.
*  Example
*  For name = "Placedo, Silver Van", the output should be
*  ShortenName(name) = "Placedo, Silver V".
*  For name = "Aguilar, Ventura", the output should be
*  ShortenName(name) = "Aguilar, Ventura".
*  The solution was consuming 210 CHARS.
