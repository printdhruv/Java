*  Problem        :
*                    You are given a sequence whose nth term is
*                                       Tn = n^2 - (n-1)^2
*                    You have to evaluate the series
*                                       Sn = T1 + T2 + T3 + ... + Tn
*                    Find Sn % (10^9) + 7
*  Input Format
*                    The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. 
*                    Each test case consists of one line containing a single integer n.
*  Constraints
*                    1 <= T <= 10
*                    1 <= n <= 10^16
*  Output Format
*                    For each test case, print the required answer in a line.
*  Example 1:
*                    Input:   2
*                             2
*                             1
*                    Output:  4
*                             1
*                                           Case 1: 4 = 1 + 3
*                                           Case 2: 1 = 1
*
*  Thoughts       => 
*                    Brute Force :- 
*                                         This approach will be to write an equation of series and calculate from 1 ... n and summing up
*                                         the all terms which are extremely slow for larger inputs and eventually we will get the timeout
*                                         errors.That can be optimized with the DP as well but memory will be used in that case along with
*                                         the timing constraint.
*                    Optimized version :-
*                                         The best approach came by doing math and reducing the term which falls down to the n^2 of an
*                                         input.Java has inbuilt class of BigInteger which handles the bignumbers which are larger and provide
*                                         all arithmetic operations as well.
