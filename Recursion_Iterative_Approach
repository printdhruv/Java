/* Programmer     : Dhruv Patel
*  Problem Name   : Factorial
*  Used In        : Practice
*  Used As        : Iterative Solution
*  Thoughts     => 
*  The following code is solved with simple iteration of a for loop.
*  We decrement value of i each iteration until it breaks condition which i is equal to 1. 
*  All iterations are resulted into the Answer variable. 
*  Benefits of Iterative solution
*  => It's doesnt require extra space as interal CPU registers pass values.
*  => Terminates when condition is proven false after transitions.
*  => An infinite loop can be there without extra space allocation.
*  => It's not obvious everytime like recursive case solutions.
