*                   Table: Person
*
*                                 +-------------+---------+
*                                 | Column Name | Type    |
*                                 +-------------+---------+
*                                 | PersonId    | int     |

*                   AddressId is the primary key column for this table.
*
*Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following information for each person in the Person table,
*regardless if there is an address for each of those people:
*                     FirstName, LastName, City, State
*  Thoughts       => 
*                    Left Join :-
*                                                    We get the FirstName,LastName from the Person table and City,State from the
*                                                    Address table.The choice of join will be the Left Join where we get each match
*                                                    for valid row of the Person in Address where we validate PersonId as a condition.

SELECT Person.FirstName, Person.LastName, Address.City,Address.State FROM Person LEFT JOIN Address ON Person.PersonId=Address.PersonId;
